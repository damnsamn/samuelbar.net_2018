The Western Australian Visitor Centre were looking to create an engaging and collaborative experience for tourists visiting the centre to find local attractions and destinations. Currently, the staff were having to recommend and write out physical itineraries for visitors by request - a labour and time intensive process.

They came to us having ordered an enormous wall-scale touchscreen - two-and-a-half metres wide - with a single requirement: a single page that links to existing Tourism WA assets. A simple goal, but working with such an unfamiliar scale, I got excited. I wanted to create something a little more useful and interactive.

I immediately got to work on a paper scale of the approximate size of the screen

As the sole designer on the project, generated User Experience Designs for a 2.5m x 1.5m touch screen to be installed in the Western Australia Visitor Centre.

During wireframing process, created life-scale physical prototype to design for ideal real-world ergonomics and measurements.
