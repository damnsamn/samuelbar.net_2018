<a class="link link-blue link-external" href="https://corevision.com.au/" title="Visit CoreVision's Website">CoreVision</a> tasked us with creating a new platform to enable building tenants to interact with their buildings' services in ways that enrich their lives, rather than getting in the way. While their existing MyBuildings suite allowed building owners and their tenant organisations a high degree of control for building management (such as logging work requests and managing contractors) - it didn't allow for individuals to interact with the building or its many services.

MyLocus is a configurable platform that enables individual tenants to interract with their building and the services, retail and events that it provides. It also serves as a public website, which enables guests to browse what the building has on offer, and assists them in wayfinding to the building and between its retail offerings.

In partnership with <a class="link link-blue link-external" href="https://drawhistory.com/" title="Visit DrawHistory's website">DrawHistory</a>'s Jeffery Effendi we ran UX Workshops, collaborating with the client to generate personas and user journeys. Jeff and I worked together to create some initial wireframes for key screens, and an over-arching Information Architecture (IA) for the product.

Once the final designs received the go-ahead, myself and two other Diversus developers begun the development process, using Umbraco and AngularJS. Handling most of the HTML, CSS/Sass and JS/Angular I took a huge amount of pride in translating the final designs into the front-end as accurately as possible. A highlight for me was creating a small Sass library to force images to maintain any given aspect ratio, controlled either via Sass @mixins or HTML classes.
